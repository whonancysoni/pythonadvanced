Using reflection, we can write one recursive reverse function that will work for strings, lists, and any other sequence that supports slicing and concatenation. If an obj is a reference to a string, then Python will return the str type object. Further, if we write str() we get a string which is the empty string. In other words, writing str() is the same thing as writing “”. Likewise, writing list() is the same thing as writing []."
