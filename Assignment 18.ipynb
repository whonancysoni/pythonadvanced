    "Text files are special subset of binary files that are used to store human readable characters as a rich text document or plain text document. Text files also store data in sequential bytes but bits in text file represents characters. where as Binary files are those typical files that store data in the form of sequence of bytes grouped into eight bits or sometimes sixteen bits. These bits represent custom data and such files can store multiple types of data (images, audio, text, etc) under a single file."

    "Text files are less prone to get corrupted as any undesired change may just show up once the file is opened and then can easily be removed whereas binary files can be used instead of text files for image data/video/audio. For many types of data, binary representations are much more space-efficient. For instance, you could represent an image as a text file. But any color represented as a 24-bit RGB value in a binary file has to be represented as a six-character code (e.g. FFFFFF for white) in text, which is literally twice as many bits. Another reason for using binary formats is that they can map directly onto the internal representation of the data that the program is using. If my program uses a complex data structure that’s full of integer, float, and byte values, when I read it in from a text file I have to parse every character of text and interpret it, spending processing time (and writing logic) to figure how to convert the 88 bits in “2983102931,” into the 32-bit integer that the text represents. If I read it from a binary file, the program just copies those 32 bits from the file into memory."

The pickled byte stream can be used to re-create the original object hierarchy by unpickling the stream. This whole process is similar to object serialization in Java or .Net."
